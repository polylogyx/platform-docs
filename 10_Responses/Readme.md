Response Actions
=================================== 

```diff
! Only available in the Enterprise Edition of the PolyLogyx ESP. !
```


PolyLogyx platform provides the security administrator abilities to take certain controlled actions in response to the detection of an intrusion, or attempt of one. These actions can allow the admininstrator to:

a) Delete a file from the endpoint

b) Terminate a process on the endpoint

c) Push a host firewall rule on the endpoint for containment, or limit, the network access

d) Re-Start an agent remotely

The response actions are available on Windows endpoints only. 

Perform these steps to take a response.
1. Access the web interface for the server.
2. Navigate to SOC Operations > Response.
